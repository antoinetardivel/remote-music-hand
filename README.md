# Handify

Handify is an interface for creating sounds ðŸŽ¶ based on hand gestures ðŸ‘‹. There is one note per finger lowered. You have to lower your fingers one after the other to create your music âœ¨

To begin, allow the page to access the camera and place your hand your hand in front of it. Your hand should be positioned flat and in the centre of the of the detection area.

Think to spread your fingers fingers apart to facilitate detection.

It's up to you! One finger down corresponds to one note. For the moment the site only detects one note by one note.
